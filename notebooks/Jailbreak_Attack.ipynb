    "# \n",
    "# **目标:** # 根据项目总结，先前的词汇扰动攻击（TextBugger, PWWS）对7B规模的LLM无效。本实验将测试更高级的攻击范式——越狱攻击——以评估 Alpaca-7B 模型的安全护栏鲁棒性。\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **方法:**\n",
    "# 1.  加载 `circulus/alpaca-7b` 模型 (或您本地的 `./alpaca/alpaca_ckpt` 路径)。\n",
    "# 2.  定义一个“禁止性问题”（例如，询问如何制作危险品）。\n",
    "# 3.  定义一系列“越狱提示”（Jailbreak Prompts），包括基线（直接提问）、角色扮演攻击等。\n",
    "# 4.  将“越狱提示”与“禁止性问题”组合，发送给模型。\n",
    "# 5.  评估模型的回复，以确定攻击是否成功。\n",
